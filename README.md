# Something-Like-Caffeine

Reason to create:
PC locks in 5 minutes inactivity and Unable to download Caffeine, so I made my own.

Just a simple Windows Form Application press J key every 4 seconds.
I was new to C#, so might not be perfect but does its job.

How to use:
Click to start it.
Reset to stop it.
