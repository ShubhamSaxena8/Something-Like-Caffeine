# Something-Like-Caffeine

Reason to create:<br>
PC locks in 5 minutes inactivity and Unable to download Caffeine, so I made my own.<br>

Just a simple Windows Form Application press J key every 4 seconds.<br>
I was new to C#, so might not be perfect but does its job.<br>

How to use:<br>
Run the TestWPApp.exe in bin/debug folder.<br>
Click to start it.<br>
Reset to stop it.<br>
